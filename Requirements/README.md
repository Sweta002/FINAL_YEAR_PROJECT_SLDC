## REQUIREMENTS:


## INTRODUCTION:


Microgrids with distributed generation (DG) provide a resilient solution in the case of major faults in a distribution system due to natural disasters and help in quick restoration of power.
The main concern of grid resilience is restoring the power as soon as possible by disconnecting the faulty and healthy phases.
The project focuses on clustering of the nodes using graph algorithms in an efficient way that helps to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy systems after a fault taking into consideration the power restoration after a fault and work on managing the grid effectively during a calamity by isolating the fault for the smooth restoration process.
The project also deals with algorithms to isolate the distribution system into separate systems after a fault, i.e, change the topological structure of the distribution system after fault and then on optimal positioning of DG based on the vulnerability index or probability of failure before and after fault followed by a comparative study on the positioning of DG based on the Newton Raphson load flow analysis and the probability of failure analysis for both the cases.

## COST AND FEATURES:


## COST:


The software was free of cost.

## FEATURES:


The features of the project include:

Isolation of the faulty part from the healthy systems

Restructuring of the distribution network

Optimal sizing and positioning of DG for power restoration.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:





## 4Ws and 1Hs:



## WHO:


The persons in the power distribution center for quick isolation and restoration of power

## WHAT:

The approach isolates healthy and unhealthy distribution systems and also restructure the network to provide electric power using DG efficiently

## WHEN:


When there is an electrical fault then this approach can be used.

## WHERE:


In the power distribution network.
