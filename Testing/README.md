## TESTING:

## HIGH LEVEL TEST:

Identification and isolation of fault from the distribution network- requirement based test- Passed

Restructuration of the network- requirement based test- passed

Optimization of power restoration after fault using vulnerability index - requirement based test - passed

## LOW LEVEL TEST:

Calculation of shortest impedance route - using Kruskal graph Algorithm - passed .

Calculation of number of connected components in the distribution graph network using graph traversal - passed.

Calculation of all paths from a given node to target nodes - also the shortest route from a source node to target taking vulnerability index as weight- using Djikstra algorithm - passed.


The tests were carried out for a 16 bus 3 feeder distribution system and a 33 bus radial distribution system assuming a single line ground fault at a certain point between two buses.
The data obtained was analysed and the requirements were achieved.
